# Onyx - Crystal Stdlib

Onyx uses the StdLib of Crystal to make the collaborative universe horizons wider.
If you click on a link to source-code for anything in the docs, it will therefore look a bit different. Types has different names in some cases and the stdlib source is written in Crystal. If we had the stdlib written in Onyx now, it would make compatibility with the Crystal module universe much harder to maintain.

As long as you're staying in the docs, no such confusion arises ;-) If something isn't documented well enough, please feel free to PR; even a rudimentary, grammatically incorrect doc is better than no doc, so don't feel bothered if English is not your first language and you're not completely comfortable in it. I'm not - doesn't stop me. Someone better at that will hopefully help us fine tune that.
